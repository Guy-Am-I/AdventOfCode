These are my solutions to the Advent of Code Challange December 2019!
I am doing this just for fun and practicing my programming skills as well as imporving and staying sharp :)

Feel free to use my solutions as a guideline/help, I will try to make them readable and understandable
More importantly I would love any comments and advice on my code regrading anythign from Readability to Design Patterns
to Complexities and just general tips to help me create better solutions and imporve my coding style

Good Luck to everyone participating and go code!
